# my-maker-portfolio
This repository tracks my learning journey as I explore engineering concepts, build hands-on projects, and reflect on what I discover along the way.

## About Me

Iâ€™m Saarthak, a Class 10 student and a passionately curious learner of science and technology. I am working on learning and building projects to explore the working of universe and the secrets of cosmos

## Purpose of This Repository

On May 29, 2025, I created this repository as my first step on GitHub â€” a space to:

- Document what I learn 
- Share the projects I build  
- Track how my skills and thinking evolve over time  

---

## What to Expect

As a beginner on GitHub, Iâ€™ll be updating this repo regularly with:

- ðŸš€ logs of my achievements and milestones  
- ðŸ§  Reflections on concepts Iâ€™ve understood  
- ðŸ”§ Code from my projects  
- ðŸ“ˆ Milestones I achieve along the way

## Vision

This repo is more than a log â€” itâ€™s the beginning of my journey. I hope to work for the welfare of the **world** by meaningfully contributing to science and filling the gap in society and mindset of people.

## My Interests

- Mathematics and Physics are the subjects I find most appealing to my intellect and conscience
- For me Mathematics alone is abstract and pure observation is messy but, combining them leads to the birth of the most elegant and descriptive subject-    Physics
- Other than this I believe that Physics is the medium through which universe reveals itself and Mathematics is the language in which is does so 

### ðŸ“… Account of My Learnings 

- I am currently a Class 10 student under the CBSE curriculum.
- Completed in-depth practice of foundational Class 10 mathematics chapters that are essential for understanding Class 11 concepts.
- Started studying Class 11 mathematics in advance to strengthen my base for competitive exams and further studies.
- Explored the **Theory of Relativity**, focusing on conceptual and theoretical understanding(obviously not on the Mathematical part).
  - Read about the contributions of **Albert Einstein** and **Roger Penrose**, in the context of black holes and spacetime.
- Began the **CS50â€™s Introduction to Python** course by Harvard University and **MIT OpenCourseWare: Single Variable Calculus (18.01)** course by MIT university .
