# my-maker-portfolio
This repository tracks my learning journey as I explore engineering concepts, build hands-on projects, and reflect on what I discover along the way.

## About Me

Iâ€™m Saarthak, a Class 10 student and a passionate learner of science and technology. I am working on learning and creating beginner-level projects involving Python, Arduino, and physics, and Iâ€™m on my way to understand how technology really works â€” not just use it.

## Purpose of This Repository

On May 29, 2025, I created this repository as my first step on GitHub â€” a space to:

- Document what I learn each month  
- Share the projects I build  
- Track how my skills and thinking evolve over time  

---

## What to Expect

As a beginner on GitHub, Iâ€™ll be updating this repo regularly with:

- ðŸš€ Monthly logs of my learning  
- ðŸ§  Reflections on concepts Iâ€™ve understood  
- ðŸ”§ Code and circuits from my projects  
- ðŸ“ˆ Milestones I achieve along the way  

---

## Long-Term Vision

This repo is more than a log â€” itâ€™s the beginning of my engineering journey. I hope to one day contribute to the world through meaningful, well-built technology.
